## Data Files

### Figure 6.2 - Spiral Galaxy Rotation Curves

The `Sofue99/` folder contains data for spiral galaxy rotation curves of class Sb including the Milky Way
Galaxy, normalized to $r_\odot = 8$\,kpc and $v_\mathrm{circ} = 200\,\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$.  Original
data are from Sofue et al. [1999, ApJ, 523, 136](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999ApJ...523..136S), downloaded
from Sofue's online repository at the University of Tokyo [RC99](https://www.ioa.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~sofue/RC99/rc99.htm).

### Figure 6.3 - Density and speed profiles

`Fig6_3.txt` is an ascii multi-column text file with radial density and circular speed profiles for Jaffe,
Hernquist, and Navarro, Frenk, and White (NFW) models calculated by the author.

### Figure 6.6 - Model disk rotation curves

`Fig6_6.txt` is an ascii multi-column text file with rotation curves for three model disks: point, spherical, and exponential, calculated by the author.
