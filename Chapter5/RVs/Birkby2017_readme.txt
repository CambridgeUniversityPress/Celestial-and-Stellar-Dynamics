Abstract:
    We report the detection of water absorption features in the day side
    spectrum of the first-known hot Jupiter, 51 Peg b, confirming the
    star-planet system to be a double-lined spectroscopic binary. We use
    high-resolution (R{approx}100000), 3.2{mu}m spectra taken with
    CRIRES/VLT to trace the radial-velocity shift of the water features in
    the planet's day side atmosphere during 4 hr of its 4.23 day orbit
    after superior conjunction. We detect the signature of molecular
    absorption by water at a significance of 5.6{sigma} at a systemic
    velocity of V_sys_=-33+/-2km/s, coincident with the 51 Peg host star,
    with a corresponding orbital velocity K_P_=133_-3.5_^+4.3^km/s. This
    translates directly to a planet mass of
    M_p_=0.476_-0.031_^+0.032^M_J_, placing it at the transition boundary
    between Jovian and Neptunian worlds. We determine upper and lower
    limits on the orbital inclination of the system of
    70{deg}<i<82.2{deg}. We also provide an updated orbital solution for
    51 Peg b, using an extensive set of 639 stellar radial velocities
    measured between 1994 and 2013, finding no significant evidence of an
    eccentric orbit. We find no evidence of significant absorption or
    emission from other major carbon-bearing molecules of the planet,
    including methane and carbon dioxide. The atmosphere is non-inverted
    in the temperature-pressure region probed by these observations. The
    deepest absorption lines reach an observed relative contrast of
    0.9*10^-3^ with respect to the host star continuum flux at an angular
    separation of 3 milliarcseconds. This work is consistent with a
    previous tentative report of K-band molecular absorption for 51 Peg b
    by Brogi et al.

Description:
    We observed the bright star 51 Peg (G2.5V, V=5.46mag, K=3.91mag) for
    3.7hr during the night beginning 2010 October 21, using the CRyogenic
    InfraRed Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES) mounted at Nasmyth A at the VLT
    (8.2 m UT1/Antu), Cerro Paranal, Chile. The observations were
    collected as part of the ESO large program 186.C-0289. The instrument
    setup consisted of a 0.2 arcsec slit centred on 3236nm (order 17), in
    combination with the Multi-Application Curvature Adaptive Optic system
    (MACAO). The CRIRES infrared detector is comprised of four Aladdin III
    InSb-arrays, each with 1024*512 pixels, and separated by a gap of 280
    pixels. The resulting wavelength coverage of the observations was
    3.1806<{lambda}({mu}m)<3.2659 with a resolution of R{approx}100000 per
    resolution element.

    We observed 51 Peg continuously while its hot Jupiter companion passed
    through orbital phases 0.55<~{Phi}<~0.58, corresponding to an expected
    change in the planet's radial velocity of {Delta}RV_P_=-23km/s (15
    pixels on the CRIRES detectors). In total, we obtained 42 spectra,
    with the first 20 spectra each consisting of two sets of 5*20s
    exposures, and the remainder each consisting of two sets of 5*30s
    exposures. The increase in the exposure time was aimed at maintaining
    a constant signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the continuum of the
    observed stellar spectra after a sudden and significant deterioration
    of the seeing (increasing from 0.75 to 1.4 arcsec between one set of
    frames, see Section 2.3). To enable accurate sky-background
    subtraction, the telescope was nodded along the slit by 10 arcsec
    between each set of exposures in a classic ABBA sequence, with each of
    the final 42 extracted spectra consisting of an AB or BA pair. A
    standard set of CRIRES calibration frames was taken the following
    morning.

    To ensure we had its most up-to-date orbital solution, we compiled an
    extensive repository of literature and archival radial velocity
    measurements of the star 51 Peg from multiple observatories. These
    data are given in Table 1 and span observing dates from 1994 September
    15 to 2014 July 9, resulting in 639 radial velocity measurements over
    20 years. The table includes the discovery measurements from the
    ELODIE spectrograph at Observatoire Haute Provence and subsequent
    additional monitoring. We took these radial velocity measurements from
    the Naef et al. 2004 (Cat. J/A+A/414/351) compilation. We also
    included the legacy data set from Lick Observatory observed with the
    Hamilton spectrograph, taking measurements from the self-consistent
    reprocessing of all the Lick spectra presented by Fischer et al. 2014
    (Cat. J/ApJS/210/5). Finally, we included more recent additional
    monitoring from the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) at
    the Keck Observatory, and extracted RVs from observations with the
    High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at the ESO-3.6m
    telescope in 2013 (ESO program ID 091.C-0271, PI: Santos). The reduced
    HARPS spectra were obtained from the ESO Science Archive
    (http://archive.eso.org/wdb/wdb/adp/phase3_spectral/query).

Note (1): Barycentric Dynamical Time.
Note (2):
     The Lick8 radial velocities reported include a +13.1m/s velocity
     offset correction to the radial velocities extracted from Vizier, to
     account for the instrumental systematic reported in Fischer et al. 2014
     (Cat. J/ApJS/210/5). The following additional offsets, determined from a
     circular orbit fit to each dataset using EXOFAST, can be applied to place
     all of the radial velocity measurements onto the same zero-point:
     {gamma}_Lick13_=-21.70m/s,
     {gamma}_Lick8_ =-4.52m/s,
     {gamma}_Lick6_=-14.64m/s,
