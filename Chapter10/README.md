### Figure 10.2 - M15 globular cluster surface density and los velocity

Observed surface density profile and line-of-sight velocities for gobular cluster M15 and a King Model fit:
 * `M15_deBoer.txt` is an ASCII 3-column text file with data for M15 from de Boer et al. 2019, downloaded from his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tdboer/GC_profiles), file `stitched_profiles/ngc7078_numdens_profile`.
 * `M15_KingModel.txt` is an ASCII 2-colun text file with a King Model fit to the number density profile data computed by the author.
 * `M15_losvd.txt` is an ASCII 4-column text file with number-weighted line-of-sight velocity dispersion data of M15 from Baumgardt, 2017, MNRAS, 464, 2174, and Baumgardt & Hilker, 2018, MNRAS, 478, 1520
