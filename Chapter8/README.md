## Data Files

### Figure 8.1 - Density and speed profiles for King and Plummer models

Data for three King models computed using the online [BHKing calculator](http://www.cosmic-lab.eu/bhking/) on the [Cosmic-Lab website](http://www.cosmic-lab.eu/Cosmic-Lab/Home.html).
 * `KingModel_W4.txt` - ASCII 4-column text file with a King model with $W_0=4$
 * `KingModel_W8.txt` - ASCII 4-column text file with a King model with $W_0=8$
 * `KingModel_W12.txt` - ASCII 4-column text file with a King model with $W_0=12$

The Plummer model data are computed analytically in-situ by the notebook.

### Figure 8.2 - Globular cluster surface density profiles

Data and a King model fit to globular clusters NGC6366 and 47 Tucanae from de Boer et al. [2019, MNRAS, 485, 4906](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019MNRAS.485.4906D) with
the King profiles on his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tdboer/GC_profiles), folder `stitched_profiles/`
 * `NGC6366_deBoer.txt` - ASCII 3-column text file with the observed number density profile and error for NGC6366
 * `NTC6366_KingModel.txt` - ASCII 2-column text file with the King model fit to the observed NGC6366 number density profile
 * `47Tuc_deBoer.txt` - ASCII 3-column text file with the observed number density profile and error for 47 Tucanae
 * `47Tuc_KingModel.txt` - ASCII 2-column text file with the King model fit to the observed 47 Tuc number density profile
